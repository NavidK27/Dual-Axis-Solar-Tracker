# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker

Double axis solar trackers have both a horizontal and a vertical axle and so can track the suns apparent motion exactly anywhere in the world. This type of system is used to control astronomical telescopes, and so there is plenty of software available to automatically predict and track the motion of the sun across the sky. Dual axis trackers track the sun both east-to-west and north â€“to-south for added power and output and convenience.
